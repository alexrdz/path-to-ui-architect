One of the most important realizations I've had on this journey is that I need to change _how_ I think about writing code. That is to say, diving in and writing code is what I have been used to. I am sure this is mostly due to learning on my own, learning without a plan, the absence of mentors in my professional career, and that I never learned the principles of writing software.

I think this path I'm on changes that. Unfortunately, I came to this realization too late but I'm glad I arrived here.

It's a bit disheartening in that I have been working in this industry for a while and now I feel like I don't know much. But it feels like I'm on the right path.

I'm starting to see the map... but I'm not ready to explore all the regions just yet.

> Stepping out of the "I write code" phase and into the "I build systems" phase is enlightening and a huge shift in my thinking.

It's not about memorizing patterns. It's about:

- Knowing what tools are available
- Getting a feel for when they matter
- Practicing small things until they feel obvious
- Trying to build muscle memory through structured reps.
- Learning theory is necessary but not enough.
- Practice focused architectural reps
- Just enough complexity to challenge me
- Just enough constraint to keep me moving
- No need to “go deeper” right now
- I need to go wider, a few steps at a time, until I own this space like second nature
