# What Makes a Great UI Architect?

What makes a great architect in the realm of user interfaces?

I believe it's more than just mastering React, Vue, or Angular – it's about orchestrating systems and experiences that are both robust and delightful. At its core, UI architecture is about creating a mental model where your audience is multifaceted. Your users aren’t just the end customers — they’re also your fellow engineers, your DevOps team, your designers, your product managers, and even your future self.

## Architects Think in Systems

Great UI architects step outside the scope of individual features. They consider:

- **Coding guidelines**: creating structure and consistency across devs
- **Design patterns**: defining *how* and *when* to use composables, stores, services
- **Third-party libraries**: assessing tools like Lodash or Moment, and deciding how they’re integrated
- **Data flow**: defining how information moves across components, stores, and the API
- **Developer experience**: creating clarity, reducing friction, and enabling faster ramp-up

It’s not just about enforcing standards — it’s about *curating clarity*.

## Architects Serve More Than Code

Being an architect isn’t about knowing everything — it’s about **helping others find their way**.

Whether it's leveling up junior devs, clarifying confusing systems for PMs, or unblocking another engineer who’s stuck, a great architect is a facilitator. They create alignment. They make knowledge accessible. They remove obstacles before others even notice them.

## A Real Example: From Mess to Maintainable

I once picked up a bug ticket that stemmed from a feature PR. The original issue was simple: when navigating to a user’s profile from a news feed and then clicking “Back,” users were either not returned to the original page or there was no back button available because the code was not handling the navigation and navigation state correctly.

The implementation was… rough.

Routing logic, state flags, and scroll behavior were all tangled inside a Vue component’s `onMounted` hook — hard to read, hard to debug, and ultimately broken.

I could have patched it.

Instead, I stepped back and asked, "What is the desired behavior?" and "Where should this logic *really* live?"

This helped me understand the real issue rather than focusing on trying to make the existing code work.

I deleted it and rebuilt the logic inside a `beforeEnter` route guard using a composable.
I passed only the minimal data needed to the component via `meta` props. This kept the UI code clean, focused only on rendering.

That’s the difference. **Architects zoom out.** They don't ask “How do I fix this?” but "Why is it not working with the current solution/code?", "Where is the issue stemming from?" and “Where does this belong in the system?”

## The Trap: Thinking You Have to Be Everything

I’ve seen someone fall into this trap — trying to be the UI architect, the front-end visionary, the DevOps guru, the product whisperer — all at once.

The problem isn’t ambition.
It’s **ego.**

Great architects don’t overextend.
They triage. They guide. They ask for help.
They’re trusted not because they know everything, but because they know how to **enable everyone**.

## What Success Looks Like

At the end of the day, a great UI architect is a **leader** — not in title, but in presence.

Success isn’t measured in pull requests merged or meetings attended. It’s measured in:

- Devs who feel **heard**, **supported**, and **unblocked**
- Codebases that are **readable**, **reliable**, and **easy to extend**
- Systems that **scale**, both technically and culturally

A great UI architect earns trust by building bridges — between people, between patterns, and between today’s goals and tomorrow’s systems.

### TL;DR

Being a UI architect is about **clarity at scale** — across files, across people, and across time.

And it starts with a single question:

> “Who else needs to understand this?”
