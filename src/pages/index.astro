  <h1 id="welcome-to-site-name-or-just-my-path-to-ui-architecture-">¡Hola y bienvenida!</h1>
<p>This is my personal learning journal and study reference as I seek to level up from a frontend developer to a system-oriented, architecture-driven engineer.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-i-built-this">Why I Built This</h2>
<p>I built this site because I wanted more than bookmarks and saved tweets.</p>
<p>I wanted a structured, evolving system to help me learn, reflect, and improve as a frontend engineer — particularly in the areas of component architecture, design systems, refactoring, and modern JavaScript/Vue practices.</p>

<h2 id="who-this-is-for">Who This Is For</h2>
<p>Mainly for myself — but also for anyone who’s walking a similar path:  </p>
<ul data-stack data-gap="m">
<li>Engineers trying to write cleaner components  </li>
<li>Designers becoming system thinkers  </li>
<li>Seniors leveling up into architectural roles  </li>
<li>Curious devs who like structured thought</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-journey-so-far-">The Journey (So Far)</h2>
<p>I’m organizing this into major categories that represent “landmarks” on the path. You can follow them linearly or jump around.</p>
